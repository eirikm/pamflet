Pamflet to Publish News
-----------------------

Pamflet was built to publish writing that can be comfortably read from beginning to end, with a logically organized table of contents. It imitates useful patterns of *print* without the complexity of efficiently filling discreet sheets of paper. Ideally, it brings serious publishing ability to anyone with a computer and web host for static content.

Pamflet became useful to a [few people][3] for exactly that purpose, and I've lately been interested in applying its principles to another kind of publishing: **News**.

A brief and personal history of news
------------------------------------

Publishing news on the internet is perhaps the most popular problem that we recreational programmers choose to solve. The old-timers started with static site generators, and following that the field was dominated by customized web applications serving (or [trying to serve][4]) dynamic content. Lastly, we've moved to hybrid platforms that combine social networking and publishing. At that point, recreational programmers fell off the bus.

I've spent my share of time writing for the second and third incarnations of internet publishing, the personal web app and the social network. First I wrote and used my own blogging software, and even *maintained* it for a few years. Later I switched to Tumblr, to benefit from The Network. But I never really fit in there. I waited years for markdown bugs to be fixed that probably a dozen other people cared about. I lost significant work from normal app/web network issues. I lamented the total absence of version control in the workflow.

And as much as social networks are supposed bring human contact into the solitary activity of computing, for me it had the opposite effect. My writing seemed to be less seen, less reacted to, less meaningful than it was before. With my feedback loop broken, I stopped writing entirely.

It's not Tumblr's fault that it didn't work for me; it apparently fills a need for hundreds of millions of people. But for me, the constraints it placed on my work were in no way repaid by an influx of readers.

The good stuff
--------------

Pamflet was built to reproduce the *good* of print publishing, in small but useful ways. To repeat the exercise, what worked for me in blogging?

One success, I built up a small but reliable daily readership through the regular posting of "short" posts, typically a link with some brief comment on its contents. By limiting myself to a sentence or two, I could post fairly quickly but still put my voice into it. (Something I've never mastered in Twitter's even more anemic format.)

It was fun at the time, but those readers are long gone and it's safe to say that finding them again would be very difficult indeed. They didn't just leave my blog when I stopped writing; as far as I can tell they left all blogs. As early internet users we maintained a mental list of sites to check to occupy their spare time. Now, we check Facebook, Twitter, and one or two pro media properties. Web bookmarks are about as popular as book bookmarks.

But one other way that I had some luck in blogging continues to work the same. It's pretty simple: write something that resonates. Do it well and your work will be shared by online friends. And occasionally -- you won't know when, and it probably won't be your best work -- your writing will be re-broadcast by Reddit or Hacker News. Perhaps, even, by some drive-by Thought Leader.

Applying the beliefs
--------------------

Since I've decided to believe that building up a regular readership is impossible or not worth the effort, I don't need to spend time making a compelling front page. I don't need to try to keep interesting stories "above the fold", and I don't have to feel bad if I don't post anything for a month or two.

The priorities then are that the content itself should be easy to read on all popular devices, easily indexed by search engines, and easily browsable if people want to read more. All that is trivial to build once you stop worrying about a splashy front page.

Then it's just a matter of writing, publishing, and sharing through other sites. Since it makes no difference to Twitter or Google where I'm published, I'll put it with the project it's related to. In this case, my first Pamflet post is in [Pamflet][2]. See you around!

I had to perform some **deep** refactoring to enable a new organizational structure Pamflet content, and I'm not sure that I haven't broken a few things along the way.
