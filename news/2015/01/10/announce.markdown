Pamflet to Publish News
-----------------------

Pamflet was built to publish documents organized into an outline-style hierarchy. It is ["like a book"][1] if the book is technical documentation and not, say, a novel. Pamflet imitates the useful patterns of *print* publishing without the complexity of efficiently filling discreet sheets of paper. Ideally, a tool like brings the power of "serious" publishing to anyone with a computer and host for static content.

As Pamflet has become useful to a few people for exactly that purpose, I've become interested in applying its principles to another kind of publishing: News.

A brief and personal history of news
------------------------------------

Publishing news on the internet is perhaps the most popular problem for recreational programmers to solve. We started with static site generators, and following that the field was dominated by web applications implemented in scripting languages. Lastly, we've seen platforms that combine social networking and publishing.

I've spent my share of time writing for the second and third incarnations of internet publishing, the personal web app and the social network. Like most bloggers, I've burned out multiple times and on different platforms. I grew tired of maintaining my own web application for blogging, and eventually used a crawler to turn that into a static site.

I then moved my writing to Tumblr, to benefit (I thought) from the network. I never really fit in there, culturally or technically. I waited years for markdown bugs to be fixed that probably a dozen other people cared about. As much as social networks are supposed bring human contact into the solitary activity of computing, for me it had the opposite effect. My writing seemed to be less seen, less reacted to, less *felt* than it had before. The feedback loop broke, and I stopped doing it.

I don't mean to say this is Tumblr's fault that it didn't work for me; it apparently fills a need for hundreds of millions of people. But for me, the constraints it placed on my writing were in no way repaid by any influx of readers.

The good stuff
--------------

Pamflet was built to imitate the good of print publishing, in small but useful ways. Blogging has been around long enough for me to repeat the exercise. What worked for me in blogging?

One success was in building up a daily readership through the regular posting of "short" posts, typically a link with some brief comment on its contents. It's safe to say that finding these readers again would be very difficult indeed.

They didn't just leave my blog when I stopped writing; as far as I can tell we left all blogs. While early internet users used to maintain a mental list of sites to check to occupy their spare time, we now check Facebook, Twitter, and professional media. Well When maintaining a list of a dozen toolbar bookmarks is too much trouble -- or not even a feature of your primary access device -- we can all stop vying for placement in it.

But the other way I had some success in blogging carries on more or less the same, without my recent participation. It's pretty simple: write something that resonates. Do it well and your work will be shared by online friends. And occasionally -- you won't know when, and it probably won't be your best work -- your writing will show up in Reddit, Hacker News, or be shared by the thought leaders that thousands of humans follow for mysterious reasons.

Applying the beliefs
--------------------

Since I've decided to believe that building up a regular readership is impossible or not worth the effort, I don't need to spend time making a compelling front page. I don't need to try to keep interesting stories "above the fold", and I don't have to care if I write frequently or infrequently. No one cares about that.

The main concerns then are that the content itself is easy to read on all popular devices, that it is easily indexed by search engines, and easily browsable if people want to read more. This is easier without the constraint of a splashy front page: web searches will invariably land on the full page instead of an abstract, and content is consistently listed in chronological order. That's it.

After that, it's just a matter of writing, publishing, and sharing through other sites. Since it makes no difference to Twitter, or Google, where I publish my writing, I'll put it with the project it's related to: in this case, [Pamflet][2].

I had to perform some **deep** refactoring to enable a new organizational structure Pamflet content, and I'm not sure that I haven't broken a few things along the way.
